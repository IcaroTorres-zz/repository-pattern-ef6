## Disclaimer
- This template was planned depending on Dependency Injection pattern;
 
- This Unit of Work is:
	> A generic implementation, able to manage DbContexts transactions for it's repositories instances;
	> It is intended to be used with "using" blocks, beeing injected or through a FilterAttribute.

- The Repository can be used as:
	> Generic Repository implementation to handle entities;
	> Base implementation to be implemented by concrete repositories.
